# DBBANet


The official implementation of **"A Comprehensive Deep-Learning Framework for Fine-Grained Farmland Mapping from High-Resolution Images"**.

We are delighted to share that our paper has been successfully accepted by the **IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS 2024)**.

This repository contains the full implementation of our model, including training and testing.

## üåçFine-Grained Farmland Dataset (FGFD)

We have developed a groundbreaking dataset encompassing diverse types of farmland, taking into account the varying terrain across China.

You can download the whole dataset via Baidu Disk:

  Code: `FGFD`

It is worth noting that when annotating the data, we labeled farmland without crops (in red) and farmland with crops (in green). However, in practical use, we are only concerned with distinguishing between farmland and non-farmland.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Training Instructions

We have provided a series of compared methods to estabish the benckmark.

To train the provoided models, follow these steps:

1. Set the hyperparameters for training.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python train.py --batchsize 32 --model_name DBBANet --gpu_id 0

## üß™ Testing Instructions

To evaluate the trained model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the model is properly trained and paths are set.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python test.py --model_name DBBANet --batchsize 32
