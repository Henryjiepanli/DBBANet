# DBBANet


The official implementation of **"A Comprehensive Deep-Learning Framework for Fine-Grained Farmland Mapping from High-Resolution Images"**.

We are delighted to share that our paper has been successfully accepted by the **IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS 2024)**.

This repository contains the full implementation of our model, including training and testing.

## üåçFine-Grained Farmland Dataset (FGFD)

We have developed a groundbreaking dataset encompassing diverse types of farmland, taking into account the varying terrain across China.

You can download the whole dataset via Baidu Disk:

  Code: `FGFD`

It is worth noting that when annotating the data, we labeled farmland without crops (in red) and farmland with crops (in green). However, in practical use, we are only concerned with distinguishing between farmland and non-farmland.
